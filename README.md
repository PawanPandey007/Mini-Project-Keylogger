well as on-screen keyboard, and delivers keylogs through email in response to a timer.

## Description
We created a graphical user interface for simply receiving input and logging keystrokes in response to the timer. We utilised a variety of libraries such as tkinter, pynput.keyboard, logging, time, smtplib, ssl, email, threading, and so on.
## Getting Started
